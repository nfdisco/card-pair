The card pairs problem
======================

The problem was posted on Reddit in 2017 [1] and is stated as follows:

  You have one hundred cards numbered 1, ... 100.  You randomly pair
  all of the cards.  Whichever of the pair is a higher number is
  considered to be a ‘winner’.  On average, what percentage of cards
  from the upper half (51, ... 100) will be considered to be
  ‘winners’?
